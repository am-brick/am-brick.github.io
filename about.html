If you're wondering what this website is about, you're on the right page. I created this website to post text files about things that I find interesting. There are many categories to choose from, so have a look
around and you might find something you like. I was inspired by Jason Scott (whose page can be found here: http://textfiles.com) and his unique site that was a great snapshot of BBS content from the 80s and 90s.
I was fortunate enough to experience the world wide web in the late 90s and early 2000s, which I felt the designs were more focused on being personal rather than streamlined and professional.

My earliest memory of using a computer was at the age of 6, when I used to play a Pokemon puzzle game on a mini-CD frequently. I was curious as to what else you could do on a computer, but we didn't have internet at the time.
Eventually we had dial-up internet via AOL discs and I was able to explore the web in all its glory. Though I still didn't know what it was, so I mostly just went to the websites that my brothers and sisters visited. Fast forward
to 2022 and I've been using computers for a whopping 20+ years now and have seen almost everything the internet has to offer which kind of sparked the fire to create something personal that was memorable to me and maybe even
to others who visit my site.
